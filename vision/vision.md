# Vision brainstrom

## What

- Exercise "database" built with web3 tech
- Potentially hit web3 social angle
- Potentially expand to include a repository of "food"
- NFTs as workouts? 

## Incentive structure

## spitballs
- Partnerships with established gyms to grant "soulbound tokens" to existing trainers.  This will provide a way for exsiting gyms to enter the web3 space
  - What do we get out it and what does the gym/trainer get out of it?
- Establishing a greater reputation system for the web, allowing people to gain reputation that sticks with them forever
- Creating a DAO for fitness trainers and trainees with some reputation system for tracking workout success (i.e losing fat, gaining workout, etc...)
  - Incentives will revolve around providing tangible results for people looking to reach their fitness goals with the potential of monatary and/pr governance tokens as a reward
  - DAO membership with utilities (what?)
  - Need to establish a KYC process
  - Guilds: powerlifter guild, bodybuilder guild, personal trainer guild, etc...

### To research
- What are the problems today with trainers working for a traditional gym? (Dylan)
  - How much of a cut do gyms take out of a trainers income?
  - Are trainers FTE or PTE?
- Are there any fitness daos out there today? If so what are they doing and what are the gaps?
- What types of web3 fitness tools/applications exist today and what do they look to solve?

## How we get there
- TBD
