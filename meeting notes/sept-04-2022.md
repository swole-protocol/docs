  - Nothing too deep, keep high level coming up with a theoritical roadamp
  - Two sentences per step
  - Come up with an agile approach to the roadmap

# Meeting Notes

- Went over roadmap that Dylan created with details of the vision and purpose of the swole-protocol
- Discussed different ways to obtain funding
  - Seems like grant based funding is the way we're leaning with gitcoin grants

# Action items
- Narb to add details on who to run the swole-protocol frontend
- Dylan to clean up the readme from the details he outlined in the roadmap/vision
- Idea is to annouce this initative to the public via social media and post it up for grant funding on Gitcoin to see what public sentiment is towards this kind of project
